[{"Type":"Advisory","Status":"Failed","URLs":129,"Hint":"Query string contains paginated parameters","Description":"URLs that contain a query string with apparent pagination parameters (e.g. http:\/\/example.com\/search?w=shoes&p=2). URLs with lots of parameters can be considered highly dynamic, for example, faceted search URLs that include multiple filters and sorts. If these also contain pagination parameters, they could lead to issues with crawl budget or duplicate content.

Broken URLs are unwelcome, as they result in a poor user experience, and can also have a negative SEO impact, depending on the type and scale of the issue.

Ideally URLs should be lower case and not be mixed case, as mixed case URLs can lead to duplicate content, a loss of link equity to the correct version and wasted crawl budget.

If you include a second question mark in the query, this would be treated as a literal question mark (i.e. it has no significance beyond that of a regular character). Whilst this is not invalid, it is quite unusual, and may indicate some sort of issue with how URLs are generated, so it could warrant further investigation.

URLs with more than 3 parameters could be considered highly dynamic, for example, faceted search URLs that include multiple filters and sorts.

Since the second parameter is redundant, the existence of these URLs could lead to duplicate content issues, since the content would be identical to the equivalent URLs with a single parameter. This could also indicate a much bigger problem, as it might imply an issue with the logic of the underlying software which generates the URLs in the first place.

Since 'search' URLs present the same content in a different order, they don't offer a way for search engines to discover new content, so you typically don't want them spending time crawling these URLs if there are more important unique URLs that are being neglected from a crawl perspective.

A double slash in the URL path is valid and will respond in the browser, but is typically unwelcome, as this could cause duplicate content issues if the CMS delivers the same content on two URLs (i.e. single slash and double slash).

Repetitive elements in URL paths are usually caused when the crawler comes across links with relative URLs and the page doesn't have a base URL e.g. https:\/\/example.com\/pages\/pages\/page1. They can be generated by Content Management Systems, plugins or broken HTML.  A common false positive for this Hint is dates in the path - these can normally be ignored e.g. https:\/\/example.com\/2017\/11\/11\/page-name","Learn More":"https:\/\/sitebulb.com\/hints\/internal\/url-contains-repetitive-elements\/"},{"Type":"Issue","Status":"Pass","URLs":0,"Hint":"URL contains whitespace","Description":"URLs that contain one or more whitespace characters in the path (e.g. http:\/\/example.com\/page 1).
