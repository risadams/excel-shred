0,Advisory,Failed,709,URL received search traffic but 0 goal conversions,"URLs that received organic search traffic with zero goal conversions, per the connected Google Analytics account. If a page has received organic search traffic but no goal conversions, it may mean that the page is poorly set up from a conversion perspective. However, given that it may be perfectly normal for the majority of pages on a site to achieve no goal conversions, please be aware that this Hint is only Advisory.

1,Advisory,Failed,534,URL received no organic search traffic,"URLs that received no organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a page has received no organic search traffic, this is obviously a bad sign from an SEO perspective. It may indicate that the content is low quality, and doesn't do a good job providing an answer for relevant search queries. It may be due to the page having poor link equity - if the page has very few internal links, for instance - which would also make it difficult to rank well in organic search.

2,Advisory,Failed,430,Had bounce rate greater than or equal to 80%,"URLs that received organic search traffic with a bounce rate of 80% or more, per the connected Google Analytics account. Bounce rate is an engagement metric, so if visitors regularly come to the page and then bounce straight back to the SERPs, it could be an indication that the page is low quality, or the content does not provide a satisfactory answer to ranking search queries.

3,Advisory,Failed,283,Average time on page less than or equal to 10s,"URLs that received organic search traffic with time on page less than 10 seconds, per the connected Google Analytics account. If a page has an average time on page of 10 seconds or less, this could be an indication that the page is low quality, or the content does not provide a satisfactory answer to ranking search queries.

4,Issue,Failed,98,Not Found (4XX) URL received search traffic,"URLs that are Not Found (4XX), yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL returns a status of 404 (Not Found), this means that the content is no longer accessible. If search engine users are ending up on 404 pages, they would receive an extremely unsatisfactory result, which offers a very poor user experience and reflects poorly on the brand.

5,Issue,Failed,93,Orphan URL received search traffic,"URLs that are not part of the crawlable website architecture, yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. Orphaned URLs should not really exist - they are normally accidental, or the result of a problem yet to be fixed. In this case, either the page should not be orphaned, and is probably missing out on MORE search traffic, or the page should be orphaned, and should not be receiving traffic at all.

6,Issue,Failed,3,Redirect (3XX) URL received organic search traffic,"URLs that redirect, yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL is redirected yet receiving search traffic, this means that the 'wrong' URL is indexed in Google - it should be the redirect destination URL instead. Redirects don't deliver a terrible user experience - as they still result in the user ending up on the right page (usually), but they do add an extra unnecessary hop, increasing the time it takes for the user to see rendered content.

7,Issue,Pass,0,Canonicalized URL received organic search traffic,"URLs that are canonicalized to another URL, yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL is canonicalized then a specific instruction has been given to search engines to NOT index the page. Yet since URLs need to be indexed in order to receive organic search traffic, this implies that search engines may be ignoring the canonical instruction.

8,Issue,Pass,0,Disallowed URL received organic search traffic,"URLs that are disallowed in robots.txt, yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL is disallowed then a specific instruction has been given to search engines to NOT crawl the page - typically this means that the website owner does not want the URL appearing in search results - but if the URL is receiving search traffic then this implies that it is indexed. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/search-traffic/disallowed-url-received-organic-search-traffic/
9,Issue,Pass,0,Forbidden (403) URL received search traffic,"URLs that are Forbidden (403), yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL returns a status of 403 (Forbidden), this means that the content is not accessible. If search engine users are ending up on 403 pages, they would receive an extremely unsatisfactory result, which offers a very poor user experience and reflects poorly on the brand.

10,Issue,Pass,0,Noindex URL received organic search traffic,"URLs that are noindex, yet received organic search traffic, per the connected Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts. If a URL is noindex then a specific instruction has been given to search engines to NOT index the page. Yet since URLs need to be indexed in order to receive organic search traffic, this implies that search engines may be ignoring the robots directive.

11,Advisory,Pass,0,Only has desktop organic search traffic,"URLs that only received organic search traffic from desktop devices, per the connected Google Search Console account. This should be considered a flag - why did the page receive visits on desktop devices, but not tablet or mobile devices? It could signal an issue with search performance for the page on mobile and tablet devices. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/search-traffic/only-has-desktop-organic-search-traffic/
12,Advisory,Pass,0,URL only received mobile organic search traffic,"URLs that only received organic search traffic from mobile devices, per the connected Google Search Console account.
