0,Advisory,Failed,145,Canonical points to a different internal URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which is not self-referential, and instead points to another internal URL. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it could be the case that nothing is actually wrong here - canonicals are used as a valid means of avoiding duplicate content issues - so you may simply wish to check that the canonicals are pointing at the 'right' URLs. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-different-internal-url/
1,Issue,Failed,130,Next/Prev Paginated URL is canonicalized to different URL,"URLs that are canonicalized (i.e the canonical URL points to another URL), where the URL also has next/prev pagination elements. This is typically seen where rel=canonical points to the first page of a paginated series. Using rel=canonical in this manner can result in content on paginated pages not being indexed at all. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/nextprev-paginated-url-is-canonicalized-to-different-url/
2,Advisory,Failed,71,Noindex found on rel Next/Prev Paginated URL,URLs that are noindex where the URL also has next/prev pagination elements. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it could be the case that nothing is actually wrong here - noindex and rel='next'/'prev' are entirely independent annotations - so you may simply wish to check that this deliberate and working as expected. ,https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/noindex-found-on-rel-nextprev-paginated-url/
3,Issue,Failed,70,Canonical points to a noindex URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which is noindex. This constitutes conflicting messages to search engines, and as such the canonical instruction will likely be ignored. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-noindex-url/
4,Advisory,Failed,1,Paginated URL missing next/prev canonicals,"URLs that contain pagination HTML elements, but do not include next/prev canonicals in the HTML or in HTTP Headers. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it not technically necessary to use next/prev elements, however it is recommended by search engines and considered best practice. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/paginated-url-missing-nextprev-canonicals/
5,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical is a relative URL,URLs that specify a canonical URL using a relative URL. Search engines do not recommend using relative URLs for canonicals as they can lead to future issues (even if there are no issues currently). ,https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-is-a-relative-url/
6,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical is malformed or empty,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which is invalid or undefined. If canonical URLs are undefined (e.g. <link rel=""canonical"" href="""">) or invalid (e.g. <link rel=""canonical"" href=""http//example.com/"">) this indicates a configuration issue and should be addressed. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-is-malformed-or-empty/
7,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical loop,"URLs that specify a canonical URL, where the canonical URL also specifies a canonical, which in turn points back to the original URL. This causes a canonical loop (e.g. URL1 -> URL2 -> URL1) and could cause search engines to completely ignore all canonical instructions. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-loop/
8,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical outside of head,"URLs that have a canonical link element in the HTML which has been placed outside the <head>. Search engines will ignore canonical designations that do not appear in the <head>, so this issue could cause indexing problems. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-outside-of-head/
9,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to a disallowed URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which is disallowed by robots.txt. Search engines will be unable to crawl the disallowed URL, so the canonical instruction will likely be ignored. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-disallowed-url/
10,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to a noindex nofollow URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which is noindex nofollow. This constitutes conflicting messages to search engines, and as such the canonical instruction will likely be ignored. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-noindex-nofollow-url/
11,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to a redirecting URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which returned Redirect (3XX) when crawled by Sitebulb. This indicates to search engines that the canonical information is inaccurate, and as such, the canonical instruction may be ignored. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-redirecting-url/
12,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to a URL that is Error (5XX),"URLs that specify a canonical URL which returned Error (5XX) when crawled by Sitebulb. This can indicate to search engines that the canonical information is inaccurate, and as such, the canonical instruction may be ignored. Server errors can be transient, so it is worth double checking the error URLs to verify there is an issue. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-url-that-is-error-5xx/
13,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to a URL that is Not Found 404,"URLs that specify a canonical URL which returned Not Found (4XX) when crawled by Sitebulb. This indicates that the canonical URL has either been removed or misconfigured, and as such, the canonical instruction is likely to be ignored by search engines. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-a-url-that-is-not-found-404/
14,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to another canonicalized URL,"URLs that specify a canonical URL, where the canonical URL also specifies a (different) canonical URL. This causes a canonical chain (e.g. URL1 -> URL2 -> URL3) and could cause search engines to completely ignore all canonical instructions. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-another-canonicalized-url/
15,Advisory,Pass,0,Canonical points to external URL,URLs that specify a canonical URL which is on a different domain or subdomain. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it could be the case that nothing is actually wrong here - cross-domain canonicals are used as a valid means of avoiding duplicate content issues - so you may simply wish to check that the canonicals are pointing at the 'right' URLs. ,https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-external-url/
16,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to HTTP version,"HTTPS URLs that specify a canonical URL which is the HTTP version of the same URL (i.e. mismatched protocol). This could lead to search engines indexing the 'wrong' version of the URL, or ignoring the canonical instruction entirely. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-http-version/
17,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical points to HTTPS version,"HTTP URLs that specify a canonical URL which is the HTTPS version of the same URL (i.e. mismatched protocol). This could lead to search engines indexing the 'wrong' version of the URL, or ignoring the canonical instruction entirely. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-points-to-https-version/
18,Advisory,Pass,0,Canonical tag in HTML and HTTP header,"URLs that have a canonical URL defined both in the HTML and in the HTTP header. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it is not 'wrong' per se, but could lead to future complications if changes are made to one canonical element but not both. As such, we recommend only using one method of declaring canonical URLs. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-tag-in-html-and-http-header/
19,Issue,Pass,0,Mismatched canonical tag in HTML and HTTP header,"URLs that have a canonical URL defined both in the HTML and in the HTTP header, which are specifying different canonical URLs. This constitutes conflicting messages to search engines, and as such the canonical instruction will likely be ignored. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/mismatched-canonical-tag-in-html-and-http-header/
20,Advisory,Pass,0,Multiple canonical tags,"URLs that specify a canonical URL more than once, either in the HTML, in the HTTP header, or in both. This Hint is flagged as Advisory as it may not be 'wrong' per se, but could lead to future complications if changes are made to one canonical element but not the other. As such, we recommend that canonicals are only declared once on any given URL, using a single method (HTML or HTTP header). ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/multiple-canonical-tags/
21,Issue,Pass,0,"Multiple, mismatched canonical tags","URLs that specify a canonical URL more than once, either in the HTML, in the HTTP header, or in both, where the canonical URLs do not match. This constitutes conflicting messages to search engines, and as such the canonical instruction will likely be ignored. In this circumstance, we recommend selecting the correct canonical URL, and ensuring that canonical URLs are declared only once on any given URL, using a single method (HTML or HTTP header).  ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/multiple-mismatched-canonical-tags/
22,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical URL has no incoming internal links,"URLs that are declared as the canonical URL (on another URL), but which have no incoming anchor links from internal URLs (i.e. the only links they have are from the canonical link element). This means that a canonical URL is not part of the overall site architecture. This is an unusual situation, as any URL which is deemed important enough to act as a canonical should also be part of the overall site architecture. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-url-has-no-incoming-internal-links/
23,Issue,Pass,0,Canonical only found in rendered DOM,"URLs that contain a canonical link element on the rendered version of the page, but do not contain one in the HTML source. Google have stated categorically that the rendered canonical is not taken into account, so relying on it for indexing purposes is not recommended. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/indexability/canonical-hints/canonical-only-found-in-rendered-dom/
24,Issue,Pass,0,Rendered Canonical is different to HTML source,"URLs that contain a canonical link element on the rendered version of the page, which is different to the one in the source HTML. Google have stated categorically that the rendered canonical is not taken into account, so relying on it for indexing purposes is not recommended. At best, this situation leads to ambiguity - at worst, search engines will select the wrong version and you could damage organic search traffic.
