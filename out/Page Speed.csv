0,Issue,Failed,1140,Critical (Above-the-fold) CSS was not found,"URLs that do not include critical CSS content in the <head>. Optimize the critical rendering path by inlining critical CSS in the <head>, which allows above-the-fold content to render in the browser without waiting for the rest of the CSS to load. ",
1,Issue,Failed,1140,HTML content is not minified,"URLs that contains HTML which is not minified or could be minified further. Minification works by analyzing and rewriting the text-based parts of a file to reduce its overall size, resulting in faster response times and lower bandwidth costs. ",
2,Issue,Failed,1140,Contains one or more single point of failure,"URLs that have one or more single point of failure (SPOF). If you load 3rd party JavaScript, CSS or fonts synchronously inside the HTML <head>, these files could fail to load and stop the entire page from loading. ",
3,Advisory,Failed,1009,Transferred image size is over 100KB,"Image URL files that are over 100KB, which is generally considered large. One of the easiest ways you can improvem page load speed is by optimizing images and properly sizing them to the size that is rendered. ",
4,Issue,Failed,993,Total combined CSS content size is too big (over 500KB),"URLs for which the total byte size of the CSS resources is greater than 500KB. If the total downloaded CSS is too big, then the browser needs to do more work parsing CSS ready against the HTML, which makes rendering slower. ",
5,Issue,Failed,981,URL loads in one or more identical JavaScript Resource,URLs that load in one or more identical JavaScript resource (that have the same content but are loaded from different URLs). Duplicate JavaScript resources hurt performance by creating unnecessary HTTP requests. ,
6,Issue,Failed,808,Total combined JavaScript content size is too big (over 500KB),"URLs for which the total byte size of all the JavaScript resources is greater than 500KB. If the total downloaded JavaScript is too big, then the browser needs to do more work parsing and compiling the scripts, which makes rendering slower. ",
7,Issue,Failed,266,Server response too slow with a Time-to-First-Byte greater than 600ms,"URLs that had a Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB) greater than 600ms. TTFB is a measure of how long it takes to receive data from the server, and high TTFB is a cause of slow page load. ",
8,Issue,Failed,133,Total combined Image content size is too big (over 1MB),"URLs for which the total byte size of all image content is greater than 1MB. Large images, lots of images, or poorly compressed images will have a negative effect on load time and increase bandwidth. ",
9,Issue,Failed,102,Uncompressed text content resources,URLs that contain text content which has not been compressed. Text compression minimizes the byte size of network responses that include text content. Compressing text content with gzip saves download bytes and reduces bandwidth for the user. ,
10,Issue,Failed,6,Style Sheet is larger than 14.5KB,"URLs that use a CSS file which is greater than 14.5KB. The browser can download the CSS faster if each CSS response is small (less than 14.5 KB), so the page will start to render earlier. ",
11,Issue,Failed,6,Too many requests per domain,"URLs that make more than 30 concurrent requests to any one domain. When using HTTP/1, browsers have a limit on how many concurrent requests they can do per domain. Once this limit is hit, the browser will need to wait before it can download more assets on that domain - so avoid this additional wait time by having less requests per domain. Note that this hint can be ignored for any website implementing HTTP/2.",
12,Issue,Failed,4,CSS content is not minified,"URLs that use a a Style Sheet which contains CSS content that is not minified or could be minified further. Minification works by analyzing and rewriting the text-based parts of a file to reduce its overall size, resulting in faster response times and lower bandwidth costs. ",
13,Issue,Failed,3,JavaScript content is not minified,"URLs that load JavaScript files which contain JavaScript content that is not minified or could be minified further. Minification works by analyzing and rewriting the text-based parts of a file to reduce its overall size, resulting in faster response times and lower bandwidth costs. ",
14,Issue,Failed,2,Resources that do not specify cache headers,"Resource URLs, such as images or JavaScript files, that do not specify a cache header. Fetching something over the network is both slow and expensive. Large responses require many roundtrips between the client and server, which delays when they are available and when the browser can process them, and also incurs data costs for the visitor. Setting a cache header on your server response will tell the browser that it doesn't need to download assets again, which avoids unnecessary requests to the server. ",
15,Issue,Failed,2,Static resources have private a cache-control header,"Resource URLs, such as images or JavaScript files, that specify a private cache-control header. These responses are typically intended for customizing the browsing experience for a single user. Static content should be cached and used by all users, so avoid setting the cache to private. ",
16,Issue,Failed,2,Loads overweighted webfonts,"URLs that load in one or more webfonts that are above 50KB. Webfonts that are over this size are probably not optimized for the web, and slow down rendering. ",
17,Issue,Failed,2,Duplicate Javascript Files,"JavaScript file URLs that are technically duplicated - the URLs are the same other than a query string, and the file size and body content are identical. This typically comes from developers adding version numbers or timestamps to page resources, and can be problematic as you lose the ability to cache the resources across multiple pages. In reality, if this only affects a handful of URLs this is not a big issue, but if it affects thousands of URLs then it is a much bigger problem. ",
18,Issue,Failed,1,Total combined size of the webfonts used is too big (over 200KB),"URLs that contain webfonts with a total combined size of over 200KB, which is not well optimized for the web. This could be a compresson issue, a font that contains too many glyphs or a font with complex shapes. ",
19,Issue,Failed,1,Loads in too many webfonts,URLs that load in more than 5 webfonts. Loading in lots of webfonts can slow down the rendering of content. ,
20,Issue,Pass,0,Character Set Is Not UTF-8,"URLs which have the character set defined as a value other than UTF-8. The HTML5 specification advises the use of UTF-8, which can support many languages and can accommodate pages and forms in any mixture of those languages. Its use also eliminates the need for server-side logic to individually determine the character encoding for each page served or each incoming form submission, which can have an impact on load time. ",
21,Issue,Pass,0,Character Set Not Specified In Head Or Headers,URLs which do not specify the character set in the <head> or HTTP Headers. It is important to specify a character set early (ideally in the HTTP response headers) to allow the browser to begin parsing HTML and executing scripts immediately. Without specifying a character set the browser is left to figure it out on its own which takes time and therefore negatively impacts page load times. ,
22,Issue,Pass,0,Char Set Meta Is Not First Element In Head,"URLs which specify the character set in the <head>, where it is not the first element. It is important to specify a character set as early as possible (ideally in the HTTP response headers) to allow the browser to begin parsing HTML and executing scripts immediately. ",
23,Issue,Pass,0,Character Set missing from the HTTP Headers,URLs which do not specify the character set (charset) in the HTTP Headers. It is important to specify a character set as early as possible - ideally in the HTTP response headers - to allow the browser to begin parsing HTML and executing scripts immediately. Without specifying a character set the browser is left to figure it out on its own which takes time and therefore negatively impacts page load times. ,
24,Issue,Pass,0,URL loads in one or more identical CSS Resource,URLs that load in one or more identical CSS resource (that have the same content but are loaded from different URLs). Duplicate CSS resources hurt performance by creating unnecessary HTTP requests. ,
25,Issue,Pass,0,Style sheets are not loaded first in the <head>,"URLs that contain Stylesheet <link> elements in the <head>, which are loaded after a <script> element. CSS blocks rendering, so if it is not the first thing loaded on the page, this will cause the page to render more slowly. ",
26,Issue,Pass,0,DOM depth exceeds recommended 32 nodes deep,"URLs for which the DOM has nodes exceeding the maximum recommended depth of 32. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 32 elements deep. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",
27,Issue,Pass,0,DOM width exceeds recommended 60 nodes wide,"URLs for which the DOM has a parent node with more than the recommended 60 child nodes. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 60 elements wide. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",
28,Issue,Pass,0,Critical (Above-the-fold) CSS was found in the <head> but not loaded early enough,"URLs that do include critical CSS content in the <head> (as recommended), but do not load it early enough. Critical CSS should be rendered before any JavaScript or style sheets, and ideally immediately after critical meta data. ",
29,Issue,Pass,0,Contains redirecting page resources,"URLs that contain page resources which redirect. A redirect adds an additional step for the browser to download the resource, so avoiding redirects helps with load speed. ",
30,Issue,Pass,0,Has too many synchronous JavaScript requests,"URLs that contain more than 3 synchronous JavaScript files. For every JavaScript file that the browser needs to load, it will send a separate HTTP request to the server. If these are synchronous requests then the browser will need to allow each one to finish before moving on to the next. Fewer files means fewer requests, and therefore a faster load speed. ",
31,Advisory,Pass,0,Downloaded HTML is greater the 500KB,"URLs for which the total byte size of the downloaded HTML is greater than 500KB, which is considered large. Pages with a lot of HTML content are very slow to load. ",
32,Issue,Pass,0,Style sheet is loaded in with media='print',"URLs that load in a specific Style Sheet just for printing. This requires the browser to load the printing Style Sheet, even if it is not going to be used. These styles should be moved to a print @media query. ",
33,Issue,Pass,0,Contains DOM elements with empty src or href attributes,"URLs that contains DOM elements with empty src or href attributes. If the browser finds an empty src or href attribute, it attempts to resolve it to the current URL or parent directory. This will cause unnecessary requests to the server, which will waste bandwidth and server resources. ",
34,Issue,Pass,0,Loads oversized images which are scaled in the browser,URLs that load oversized images which are then scaled by the browser. Scaling images in the browser is bad for performance as it takes extra CPU time and the user ends up downloading data they don't use. Instead create multiple versions of the same image server-side and serve the appropriate one to the user. ,
35,Issue,Pass,0,Loads offscreen images that appear below the fold,"URLs that load offscreen, below-the-fold images, during the initial request. Users cannot initially see below-the-fold images, so these can be lazy loaded with JavaScript, to reduce time to interactive. ",
36,Issue,Pass,0,Loads hidden images,"URLs that load in images which are not visible (their style 'display' property is set to 'none', or one of their parents is). These images will be loaded in by the browser even though they are not visible. This will increase page load time and potentially waste additional bandwidth if the user does end up seeing them. ",
37,Advisory,Pass,0,Unoptimized JPEG images that could be compressed further,"JPEG image files that are unoptimized, and could be compressed further. Unoptimized images are slower to download and consume more bandwidth. ",
38,Issue,Pass,0,Has an excessive number of DOM nodes (greater than 1500),"URLs that contain more than 1500 elements in the DOM. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 1500 nodes in total. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",
39,Issue,Pass,0,Keep-alive not set on page resources that are used multiple times,"Page resources that close the connection and do not use keep-alive in the HTTP header. If you have multiple requests to the same domain, you can use keep-alive headers so the connection is not closed until all the requests are made. ",
40,Advisory,Pass,0,Resources that do not specify long cache headers,"Resource URLs, such as images or JavaScript files, that do specify cache headers, but for less than 30 days. For files that do not tend to change, such as images, you should look to increase the cache time period, which means the files stay in the browser cache for longer, thus avoiding extra requests to the server. You will need to manually check which files do not change regularly, and would benefit from longer cache headers. ",
41,Issue,Pass,0,Duplicate Style Sheets,"CSS file URLs that are technically duplicated - the URLs are the same other than a query string, and the file size and body content are identical. This typically comes from developers adding version numbers or timestamps to page resources, and can be problematic as you lose the ability to cache the resources across multiple pages. In reality, if this only affects a handful of URLs this is not a big issue, but if it affects thousands of URLs then it is a much bigger problem. ",
