0,Advisory,Failed,129,Query string contains paginated parameters,"URLs that contain a query string with apparent pagination parameters (e.g. http://example.com/search?w=shoes&p=2). URLs with lots of parameters can be considered highly dynamic, for example, faceted search URLs that include multiple filters and sorts. If these also contain pagination parameters, they could lead to issues with crawl budget or duplicate content. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-paginated-parameters/
1,Issue,Failed,102,Broken internal URLs,"All internal URLs that weren't successfully audited, and had a crawl status of either Not Found, Error, Forbidden or Timeout. Broken URLs are unwelcome, as they result in a poor user experience, and can also have a negative SEO impact, depending on the type and scale of the issue. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/broken-internal-urls/
2,Advisory,Failed,19,URL contains upper case characters,"URLs that contain upper cases characters in the URL (e.g. http://example.com/ContactUs). Ideally URLs should be lower case and not be mixed case, as mixed case URLs can lead to duplicate content, a loss of link equity to the correct version and wasted crawl budget. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/url-contains-upper-case-characters/
3,Advisory,Pass,0,Query string contains a question mark,"URLs that contain more than one question mark in the URL path (e.g. http://example.com/page?a=1?&a=1). If you include a second question mark in the query, this would be treated as a literal question mark (i.e. it has no significance beyond that of a regular character). Whilst this is not invalid, it is quite unusual, and may indicate some sort of issue with how URLs are generated, so it could warrant further investigation. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-a-question-mark/
4,Advisory,Pass,0,Query string contains more than three parameters,"URLs that contain a query string with more than 3 parameters (e.g. http://example.com/page?a=1&b=2&c=3&d=4). URLs with more than 3 parameters could be considered highly dynamic, for example, faceted search URLs that include multiple filters and sorts. If these are accessible to search engines, they could lead to issues with crawl budget or duplicate content. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-more-than-three-parameters/
5,Issue,Pass,0,Query string contains repetitive parameters,"URLs that contain repetitive parameters in the query string (e.g. http://example.com/page?a=1&a=1). Since the second parameter is redundant, the existence of these URLs could lead to duplicate content issues, since the content would be identical to the equivalent URLs with a single parameter. This could also indicate a much bigger problem, as it might imply an issue with the logic of the underlying software which generates the URLs in the first place.  ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-repetitive-parameters/
6,Advisory,Pass,0,Query string contains search or filter parameters,"URLs that contain a query string with apparent search or filter parameters (e.g. http://example.com/search?w=shoes). Since 'search' URLs present the same content in a different order, they don't offer a way for search engines to discover new content, so you typically don't want them spending time crawling these URLs if there are more important unique URLs that are being neglected from a crawl perspective. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-search-or-filter-parameters/
7,Advisory,Pass,0,Query string contains sort parameters,"URLs that contain a query string with apparent sort parameters (e.g. http://example.com/search?w=shoes&sort=name). Since 'sort' URLs present the same content in a different order, they don't offer a way for search engines to discover new content, so you typically don't want them spending time crawling these URLs if there are more important unique URLs that are being neglected from a crawl perspective. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/query-string-contains-sort-parameters/
8,Issue,Pass,0,URL contains a double slash,"URLs that contain a double slash in the path (e.g. http://example.com//page1). A double slash in the URL path is valid and will respond in the browser, but is typically unwelcome, as this could cause duplicate content issues if the CMS delivers the same content on two URLs (i.e. single slash and double slash). ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/url-contains-a-double-slash/
9,Advisory,Pass,0,URL contains non-ASCII characters,"URLs that contain characters outside the ASCII set (e.g. http://example.com/pag√©). This is dangerous as you cannot be certain how search engines or browsers will handle these characters, which could cause unwelcome results if there are issues with the encoding procedure. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/url-contains-non-ascii-characters/
10,Advisory,Pass,0,URL contains repetitive elements,"URLs that contain repetitive elements in the URL path, which can cause duplicate content issues or broken internal links. Repetitive elements in URL paths are usually caused when the crawler comes across links with relative URLs and the page doesn't have a base URL e.g. https://example.com/pages/pages/page1. They can be generated by Content Management Systems, plugins or broken HTML.  A common false positive for this Hint is dates in the path - these can normally be ignored e.g. https://example.com/2017/11/11/page-name",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/url-contains-repetitive-elements/
11,Issue,Pass,0,URL contains whitespace,"URLs that contain one or more whitespace characters in the path (e.g. http://example.com/page 1). URLs with whitespace characters are not recommended as they could cause issues when site visitors share or link to the URL, potentially leading to broken links and a loss of potential link equity. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/internal/url-contains-whitespace/
12,Issue,Pass,0,URL resolves under both HTTP and HTTPS,"URLs that resolve under both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. This could pose a security risk if users are able to access insecure content (which should be secure) and may also lead to duplicate content issues, if search engines end up crawling both HTTP and HTTPS versions.
